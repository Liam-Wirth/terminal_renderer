# Roadmap

This roadmap was ai generated by claude 3.5, I gave it all of my code as context and basically asked it "I am trying to understand how the structure of my 3d renderer differs from that of a traditional/propper 3d renderer, and what needs to be changed/updated to match a proper 3d renderer"

I also tried to combine things from my todo list into this roadmap, we'll see how it turns out I guess

## Implementation Notes

## New Pipeline Structure
```rust
pub struct Renderer {
    // Core systems
    state: RendererState,
    resource_manager: ResourceManager,
    pipeline: RenderPipeline,

    // Output
    display: Box<dyn Display>,
    hud: HudSystem,

    // Buffers
    chunks: Vec<BufferChunk>,
    frame_buffer: Arc<Mutex<FrameBuffer>>,
}

pub struct RenderPipeline {
    geometry_stage: GeometryStage,
    raster_stage: RasterStage,
    fragment_stage: FragmentStage,
}

pub struct GeometryStage {
    culling: CullingSystem,
    clipper: Clipper,
    vertex_processor: VertexProcessor,
}
```
