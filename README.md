# TODO
- [ ] Decouple Rendering logic from the terminal output
- [ ] Implement parallelism with rayon
- [ ] Implement more fleshed out "Tri" struct, possibly in own file
    - [ ] After that, redefine the "Faces" of a mesh to actually just be a collection of Tris
- [ ] Unify useage of Nalgebra functionality accross all files
    - Basically, I think I'm not using nalgebra to it's fullest potential and there's probably a lot of functionality I'm leaving "on the table"
- [ ] Better document code, Rust is very much self-documenting, but it's good to explain things as I go as well



# TODO (much less pressing/important)

- [ ] fix wakatime badge to update lmao
- [ ] github ci/cd with clippy and rustfmt
