## What is this branch for?
This branch is my way of storing "old versions" of the codebase for easy browsing
Still not sure what defines a version, but it's mostly stuff like major rewrites/iterations

I.E I'd only move something to the archive branch if my work over the past *n* commits was to the effect of "rip it all down and rewrite it so it doesn't suck"


May also go through main branches commit history, and pull some old versions from that and put em here
>Why not use git tags or something?
uhh idk
thats a good question, but this works for me
